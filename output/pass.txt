I move the keys, they call me the piano man. I'm classically trained nobody do it better.
We ballin', ballin', ballin', we shot callin'
Girl whats it gon take to have you close to me, Right by my side where you supposed to be
New music, you can't confuse it, With the other cliques or groups, its the Unit
Unstoppable, incredible, impeccable, its-its the Unit
Money make the world go round, New York, money make the world go round
I'm a gangsta for life
